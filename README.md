## Laravel Multi Auth using Laravel Breeze

I can provide you with a guide on how to install a Laravel project from a Git repository. Please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
   Change 'username' and 'repository' to the actual values of the repository that you want to clone.
   
2. Install Composer:
   If you don't have composer installed in your system then install composer from here: [https://getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/)

3. Go to the project directory:
   ```
   cd repository
   ```
   Now you should see the files and folders of your Laravel project in the terminal.

4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

5. Create a copy of the .env file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   This will create a new file named `.env` based on the example file. 

6. Generate an application key:
   ```
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
7. Run migrations:
   ```
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   This step may fail due to permission issues. If this is the case, you can run `php artisan migrate --pretend` to see the SQL statements that would be executed and manually execute them in your database client.

8. Start the server:
   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```
   This will start the development server at http://localhost:8000.

That's it! You have successfully installed a Laravel project from a Git repository. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
